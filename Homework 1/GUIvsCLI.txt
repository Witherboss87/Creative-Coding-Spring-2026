Interfaces were created in order to navigate through a computer in different ways. These different interfaces are Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI). While they both do the same things, they behave differently. GUI uses graphics and creates visual interactions with them, like being able to drag and drop files in a folder, double-clicking an app on a desktop, and controlling a cursor. This creates a more user-friendly experience for consumers and is what is generally used for most modern technology. CLI uses command prompts and text to guide through a computer. This requires knowledge on the different types of commands there are, but once learned, it can make processes faster than using GUI.
